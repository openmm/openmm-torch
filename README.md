OpenMM PyTorch Plugin
=====================

This is a plugin for [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) that allows [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) static computation graphs
to be used for defining an OpenMM `TorchForce` object, an [OpenMM `Force` class](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/library.html#forces) that computes a contribution to the potential energy or used as a collective variable via [`CustomCVForce`](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/simtk.openmm.openmm.CustomCVForce.html#simtk.openmm.openmm.CustomCVForce).  

To use it, you create a PyTorch model that takes a `(nparticles,3)` tensor of particle positions (in nanometers) as input and produces energy (in kJ/mol) or the value of the collective variable as output.  
The `TorchForce` provided by this plugin can then use the model to compute energy contributions or apply forces to particles during a simulation.
`TorchForce` also supports the use of global context parameters that can be fed to the model and changed dynamically during runtime.

Installation
============

Installing with conda
---------------------

We provide [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) packages for Linux and MacOS via [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/), which can be installed from the [conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openmm-torch):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openmm-torch
```
If you don't have `conda` available, we recommend installing [Miniconda for Python 3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to provide the `conda` package manager.  

Building from source
--------------------

This plugin uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system.  
Before compiling you must install [LibTorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html), which is the PyTorch C++ API, by following the instructions at https://pytorch.org.
You can then follow these steps:

1. Create a directory in which to build the plugin.

2. Run the CMake GUI or `ccmake`, specifying your new directory as the build directory and the top
level directory of this project as the source directory.

3. Press "Configure".  (Do not worry if it produces an error message about not being able to find PyTorch.)

4. Set `OPENMM_DIR` to point to the directory where OpenMM is installed.  This is needed to locate
the OpenMM header files and libraries.  If you are unsure of what directory this is, the following
script will print it out.

```python
from simtk import openmm
import os
print(os.path.dirname(openmm.version.openmm_library_path))
```

5. Set `PYTORCH_DIR` to point to the directory where you installed the LibTorch.

6. Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the directory where the plugin should be installed.  Usually,
this will be the same as `OPENMM_DIR`, so the plugin will be added to your OpenMM installation.

7. If you plan to build the OpenCL platform, make sure that `OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR` and
`OPENCL_LIBRARY` are set correctly, and that `NN_BUILD_OPENCL_LIB` is selected.

8. If you plan to build the CUDA platform, make sure that `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` is set correctly
and that `NN_BUILD_CUDA_LIB` is selected.

9. Press "Configure" again if necessary, then press "Generate".

10. Use the build system you selected to build and install the plugin.  For example, if you
selected Unix Makefiles, type `make install` to install the plugin, and `make PythonInstall` to
install the Python wrapper.

Using the OpenMM PyTorch plugin
===============================

Exporting a PyTorch model for use in OpenMM
-------------------------------------------

The first step is to create a PyTorch model defining the calculation to perform.  
It should take particle positions in nanometers (in the form of a `torch.Tensor` of shape `(nparticles,3)` as input,
and return the potential energy in kJ/mol as a `torch.Scalar` as output.  

The model must then be converted to a [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) module and saved to a file.  
Converting to TorchScript can usually be done with a single call to [`torch.jit.script()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html#torch.jit.script) or [`torch.jit.trace()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html#torch.jit.trace),
although more complicated models can sometimes require extra steps.  
See the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html) for details.  

Here is a simple Python example that does this for a very simple potential---a harmonic force attracting every particle to the origin:

```python
import torch

class ForceModule(torch.nn.Module):
    """A central harmonic potential as a static compute graph"""
    def forward(self, positions):
        """The forward method returns the energy computed from positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : torch.Tensor with shape (nparticles,3)
           positions[i,k] is the position (in nanometers) of spatial dimension k of particle i

        Returns
        -------
        potential : torch.Scalar
           The potential energy (in kJ/mol)
        """
        return torch.sum(positions**2)

# Render the compute graph to a TorchScript module
module = torch.jit.script(ForceModule())

# Serialize the compute graph to a file
module.save('model.pt')
```

To use the exported model in a simulation, create a `TorchForce` object and add it to your `System`.  
The constructor takes the path to the saved model as an argument.  
For example,
```python
# Create the TorchForce from the serialized compute graph
from openmmtorch import TorchForce
torch_force = TorchForce('model.pt')

# Add the TorchForce to your System
system.addForce(torch_force)
```

Defining a model that uses periodic boundary conditions
-------------------------------------------------------

When defining the model to perform a calculation, you may want to apply periodic boundary conditions.  

To do this, call `setUsesPeriodicBoundaryConditions(True)` on the `TorchForce`.  
The graph is then expected to take a second input, which contains the current periodic box vectors.  
You can make use of them in whatever way you want for computing the force.  
For example, the following code applies periodic boundary conditions to each
particle position to translate all of them into a single periodic cell:

```python
class ForceModule(torch.nn.Module):
    """A central harmonic force with periodic boundary conditions"""
    def forward(self, positions, boxvectors):
        """The forward method returns the energy computed from positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : torch.Tensor with shape (nparticles,3)
           positions[i,k] is the position (in nanometers) of spatial dimension k of particle i
        boxvectors : torch.tensor with shape (3,3)
           boxvectors[i,k] is the box vector component k (in nanometers) of box vector i

        Returns
        -------
        potential : torch.Scalar
           The potential energy (in kJ/mol)
        """
        # Image articles in rectilinear box
        # NOTE: This will not work for non-orthogonal boxes
        boxsize = boxvectors.diag()
        periodicPositions = positions - torch.floor(positions/boxsize)*boxsize
        # Compute central harmonic potential
        return torch.sum(periodicPositions**2)
```

Note that this code assumes a rectangular box.  Applying periodic boundary
conditions with a triclinic box requires a slightly more complicated calculation.

Defining global parameters that can be modified within the Context
------------------------------------------------------------------

The graph can also take arbitrary scalar arguments that are passed in at
runtime.  For example, this model multiplies the energy by `scale`, which is
passed as an argument to `forward()`.

```python
class ForceModule(torch.nn.Module):
    """A central harmonic force with a user-defined global scale parameter"""
    def forward(self, positions, scale):
        """The forward method returns the energy computed from positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : torch.Tensor with shape (nparticles,3)
           positions[i,k] is the position (in nanometers) of spatial dimension k of particle i
        scale : torch.Scalar
           A scalar tensor defined by 'TorchForce.addGlobalParameter'.
           Here, it scales the contribution to the potential.
           Note that parameters are passed in the order defined by `TorchForce.addGlobalParameter`, not by name.

        Returns
        -------
        potential : torch.Scalar
           The potential energy (in kJ/mol)
        """
        return scale*torch.sum(positions**2)
```

When you create the `TorchForce`, call `addGlobalParameter()` once for each extra argument.

```python
torch_force.addGlobalParameter('scale', 2.0)
```

This specifies the name of the parameter and its initial value.  The name
does not need to match the argument to `forward()`.  All global parameters
are simply passed to the model in the order you define them.  The advantage
of using global parameters is that you can change their values at any time
by calling `setParameter()` on the `Context`.

```python
context.setParameter('scale', 5.0)
```

Computing forces in the model
-----------------------------

In the examples above, the PyTorch model computes the potential energy.  Backpropagation
can be used to compute the corresponding forces.  That always works, but sometimes you
may have a more efficient way to compute the forces than the generic backpropagation
algorithm.  In that case, you can have the model directly compute forces as well as
energy, returning both of them in a tuple.  Remember that the force is the *negative*
gradient of the energy.

```python
import torch

class ForceModule(torch.nn.Module):
    """A central harmonic potential that computes both energy and forces."""
    def forward(self, positions):
        """The forward method returns the energy and forces computed from positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : torch.Tensor with shape (nparticles,3)
           positions[i,k] is the position (in nanometers) of spatial dimension k of particle i

        Returns
        -------
        potential : torch.Scalar
           The potential energy (in kJ/mol)
        forces : torch.Tensor with shape (nparticles,3)
           The force (in kJ/mol/nm) on each particle
        """
        return (torch.sum(positions**2), -2*positions)
```

When you create the `TorchForce`, call `setOutputsForces()` to tell it to expect the model
to return forces.

```python
torch_force.setOutputsForces(True)
```
